Grander Construction site plan master document

This document compiles the working plan for the Grander Construction website rebuild using Elementor, ACF Pro, and future REST API content seeding. It is organized page by page and section by section, with reusable modules, global styles, and content drafts.

It is written to be a single source of truth you can hand to Angie and Claude for parallel build out.


----------------------------------------


1. Global design system

1.1 Brand positioning and tone

Core brand idea to preserve and amplify

- Grandeur by Design. Built with Purpose.  
- High end but approachable, craftsmanship forward  
- Local authority for Upstate South Carolina custom homes and outdoor living

The magazine frames the company as Midwestern standards brought to the Upstate with a focus on craftsmanship, integrity, faith, and proven building science. fileciteturn8file0L51-L63

1.2 Color system

Use the previously defined Grander palette in Elementor Global Colors. If your last saved palette is lost, re establish with this structure

1. Primary dark  
2. Primary light  
3. Accent gold  
4. Neutral warm  
5. Neutral cool  
6. Background light  
7. Background dark  
8. Border subtle  
9. Text primary  
10. Text secondary

This list is intentionally structural so you can map exact hex values you already used before without overthinking.

1.3 Typography system

Use Adobe Typekit fonts

- Baskerville for headings and premium moments
- Corbel for body and UI

Recommended global styles for Angie to re apply quickly

1.5 Motion and interaction defaults

Remove legacy heavy page transitions. Keep micro motion

- 150 to 220ms ease for button hover, cards, and small reveals
- Respect prefers reduced motion
- Use subtle parallax only in hero blocks where it adds depth

1.6 Accessibility baseline

  1. A white top stripe containing logo, search icon, main CTAs

Fix

- The white stripe must remain sticky with the logo and CTAs
- Overlay text color should auto switch based on hero luminance using two style variants and a per page toggle

3.2 Mobile rules

5. Forms and the estimate lightbox system

5.1 Strategy

A dedicated Request an estimate page is not strictly redundant, but for a premium feel the primary interaction should be a sitewide lightbox

Recommendation

- Keep the page for SEO and fallback
- Use the lightbox as the main conversion path

5.2 Technical build

Create an Elementor template

- Estimate form container

Use ACF options for shared defaults

Embed

- as lightbox
- as inline module on Home
- as mid page CTA on Services

- “Start your project”
- “Let’s build something great”

Supporting line  
“Share a few details and our team will follow up with a realistic timeline and next steps.”

- email
- phone
- preferred contact method
